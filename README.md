# Artificial Neural Network on Bank Customers Dataset
For this project, we have a bank customers dataset that consists of a randomly sampled population of a banking customers detailing demographics and whether a customer left (or stayed at) the bank within the last 6 months.

The goal of this project is create an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to classify whether a customer will stay or leave the bank.
